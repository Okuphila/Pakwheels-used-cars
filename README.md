PakWheels is the largest online marketplace for car shoppers and sellers in Pakistan. It aggregates thousands of new, used, and certified second-hand cars from thousands of dealers and private sellers.

This project involves Extract Transform Load(ETL) process on used and new cars dataset which was scraped from PakWheels . Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA) is performed on it using Jupyter Notebook to extract key insights about the Pakistan's used cars marketplace.
In this exercise I look to find the most used car in the market, the most used engine, transmission, correlation of price, body type, which brand dominate the market and the most expensive car.
